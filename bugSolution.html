The issue is often due to a missing or improperly configured `tailwind.config.js` file or incorrect build process.  Make sure you've correctly configured Tailwind as described in the official documentation. Here's a corrected version (assuming you've already done the configuration properly):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Tailwind Button</title>
  <link href="/output.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
    Click Me
  </button>
</body>
</html>
```
