# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: styles not applying correctly to elements.

## Problem Description

A simple button element is styled using Tailwind CSS classes. However, the button remains unstyled, despite the use of apparently correct class names.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the Tailwind CSS configuration and build process are correctly set up.  This may include:

1. Verifying that the Tailwind directives are properly included in your CSS file or configuration.
2. Ensuring that the `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly configured and points to the correct CSS file.
3. Checking for any conflicts between custom CSS and Tailwind CSS classes.
4. Making sure Tailwind CSS is properly installed and configured in your project.
